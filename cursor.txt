			CURSOR.ARC

	This is a sample file illustrating the use of the MS MAKE utility
to automate the production of EXE and their associated DLL files in the OS/2
operating system.  In this case, the DLL does I/O, so  you have to add the
following statement to your CONFIG.SYS file:

			IOPL=YES

	In order to run this program, you need OS/2, MASM 5.1, and a
EGA/VGA hooked up to a color display.

	The DLL will not be able to do its I/O unless you do.  The MS 
MAKE utility in OS/2, unlike its Unix cousin, is bare of inference rules,
and details count: lines w/blank lines between them are significant, lines 
w/o blank lines between them are also, and those commas all mean something, 
so you have to be careful of what you change or the file won't work.

	The MAKE file also assumes that you are using MASM 5.1, and that
you have properly set your enviremental variables and paths to the various
files referenced.  Thus, where the MAKE file invokes a call to MASM or 
DOSCALLS.LIB, these files have to be available to it, and I haven't put any
paths into these commands.

	All this program does is make the cursor larger, wait for a keystroke,
and then exit back to OS/2 (notice that the size of the cursor gets restored
by the OS).  If you run it through Codeview, you have to trace thru a bit to 
get past the initialation routine that OS/2 loads in front of the symbolic
information (use the /L switch to load the DLL): 

        	CVP /L DOSCALLS.LIB /L OUTPUT.DLL CURSOR.EXE
